<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Ping, a passionate and curious software engineering student with a
  strong interest in building impactful, user-friendly digital solutions.
</p>

<p>
  I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Thammasat
  University, where I focus on developing skills in full-stack development,
  problem-solving, and working with real-world technologies like JavaScript,
  React, Python, Git. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant
  solutions — whether it's through code, collaboration, or creative thinking.
</p>

<p>
  When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, improving my
  chess gamed, enjoying playing badminton with my friend, or diving into
  strategy-based games and storytelling experiences.
</p>

<p>
  I'm always open to new challenges, collaboration opportunities, or just
  connecting with like-minded people in the tech community.
</p>

<p><b>Let’s build something meaningful together :)</b></p>
